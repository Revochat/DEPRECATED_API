TO DO LIST:
 
- implement user functions (Luc)
- automatisation of inserts (LÃ©o)

- optimisation of the tag system (until then it's a mess but we count from 1 to 9999 to find any jumps)
- message system (Web3 and Server chat)
- audio chat / video chat
- self destruct system for messages
- 2FA
- github permissions (can wait until there are more collaborators)

Just some ideas for the payed subscription:

   Video chat
   spotify integration
   custom badge
   text formatting (markdown)
   custom profile

some other ideas:

- add a "last seen" system ?
