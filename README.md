# Organisation of the API

- id's are usually sent in the URL
- other params such as channel_name or server_name are in the body 
- token is a header (Authorization: Bearer token)

Request is usually: 
   - GET for small and non sensitive requests (get friends, get channels, get servers)
   - POST when you are sending a lot of data and/or is sensitive (login, register, create channel, create server)

/api/
-> /v1/ 
   -> /client/get/friends/:friend_id
   -> /channel/create/private/:friend_id
   -> /server/get/:server_id
